# Python Tictactoe Game

Simple tictactoe game made in python where 2 players can face each other. I will be looking into if I can make it so that a player can play against AI. At this point I have no experience designing any sort of game AI (or making any sort of game apart from snakes and ladders really) so it will be a fun exercise
